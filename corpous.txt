I think going on camping is not better than go to the beach, because the beach is hotter than the mountains, but I think that going to the beach is more expensive, because I have to pay the airplane, the touristy guide, the hotel, and in the camping I only need to go attend, I need to go by car and the canned food is less expensive than paying all the meals of the hotel, so I have to bring more money to go camping.

When I will get on the beach sandals because the sandals are better than boot camp, as these cause much more heat than an open shoe.
The beach weather is warmer than in the mountains, as in the mountains is a humid, so I think the beach carrying a blocker stronger than a face cream.
The beach is much better for the pool and the sea, the mountains are less interesting by the river by the constant rain Because the largest river in the pool. 
In the mountains and camping clothing is warmer than the beach, because the beach is used in bathing suit and in the mountains are used coats.
